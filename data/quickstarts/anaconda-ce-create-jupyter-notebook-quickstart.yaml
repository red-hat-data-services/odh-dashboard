  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to create an Anaconda-enabled Jupyter notebook.
    Red Hat® OpenShift® Data Scientist lets you run Jupyter notebooks on our Red Hat® OpenShift Dedicated environment.

    With Anaconda Commercial edition you can access and use Anaconda packages, curated for security and compatibility.

    This quick start will get you working in a notebook in just a few minutes.

        ### To find the JupyterHub Launch action:
        1. In the **Applications** menu item, go to **Enabled** projects.
        2. Find the JupyterHub entry.
        3. Click **Launch** on the JupyterHub card to access the JupyterHub Spawner.

        A new browser tab will open displaying the JupyterHub Spawner.

    - title: Spawn an environment
      description: |-
        ### Spawning an environment:
        1. Select the Anaconda notebook image from the dropdown menu. This notebook uses Anaconda for all its packages, including Python.
        2. Select a container size; small, medium or large based on your computation needs.
        3. Click the Start button.

        The Spawner Options page will reload and indicate that the system is starting up.  Once the page displays a stop option you may proceed to the next step.

    - title: Create your first notebook
      description: |-
        ### To create a notebook, follow these steps:
        1. In the JupyterHub File menu, click File-> New -> Notebook
        2. Choose Python 3 and press select when prompted to select a kernel.

        You have now launched a Jupyter notebook and can begin writing Python.

        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that your Jupyter notebook launched with a Python 3 kernel:
          Is Python 3 displaying in the upper right notification bar of your notebook?
        failedTaskHelp:

    - title: Ensure you are subscribed to use Anaconda Commercial Edition packages.
      description: |-
        ### To verify that you are subscribed to Anaconda Commercial Edition in the notebook, follow these steps:
        1. In a notebook cell, type and run `!conda token set $ANACONDA_TOKEN` (replacing $ANACONDA_TOKEN with your own Anaconda Commercial Edition token.)
        1. Run `!conda info` in a notebook cell. 
      review:
        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that your Anaconda package manager points to the right repositories
          Do the repositories in `conda info` point to repo.anaconda.cloud instead of repo.anaconda.com?
        failedTaskHelp:
          This task isn’t verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully subscribed to Anaconda Commercial Edition
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to install Anaconda Commercial Edition packages within your Jupyter notebook using the command `conda install $PACKAGE`.  If you want to learn how to deploy
    a model, take the next quick start.

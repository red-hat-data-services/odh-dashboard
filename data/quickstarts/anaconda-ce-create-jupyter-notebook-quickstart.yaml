  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to create an Anaconda-enabled Jupyter notebook.
    Red Hat® OpenShift® Data Scientist lets you run Jupyter notebooks on our Red Hat® OpenShift Dedicated environment.

    We have configured the JupyterHub spawner to support your amazing Data Scientist explorations and model deployments using Anaconda.

    We just know you will absolutely love this amazing environment.  This quick start will get you working in a notebook in just a few minutes.

        ### To find the JupyterHub Launch action:
        1. In the **Applications** menu item, go to **Enabled** projects.
        2. Find the JupyterHub entry.
        3. Click **Launch** on the JupyterHub card to access the JupyterHub Spawner.

        A new browser tab will open displaying the JupyterHub Spawner.

    - title: Spawn an environment
      description: |-
        ### Spawning an environment:
        1. Select the Anaconda notebook image from the dropdown menu. This notebook uses Anaconda for all its packages, including Python.
        1.5. (Optional) In the "Environment Variables" section, you can set an environment variable to your Anaconda Enterprise key so that it doesn't need to be typed manually later.
        2. Select a container size; small, medium or large based on your computation needs.
        3. Click the Start button.

        The Spawner Options page will reload and indicate that the system is starting up.   Once the page displays a stop option you may proceed to the next step.

    - title: Create your first notebook
      description: |-
        ### To create a notebook, follow these steps:
        1. In the JupyterHub file menu, click file->New-> notebook
        2. Choose Python 3 and press select when prompted to select a kernel.
        3. When the new Jupyter notebook opens, verify that you see Python 3 in the upper right navigation bar.

        You have now launched a Jupyter notebook and can begin writing Python.

    - title: Ensure you are subscribed to use Anaconda Commercial Edition packages.
      description: |-
        ### To verify that you are subscribed to Anaconda Commercial Edition in the notebook, follow these steps:
        1. Create a notebook or open a terminal
        2. Run `conda info` (in a notebook, to run terminal commands, start the line with !. For example: `!conda info`)
        3. Verify that the package repositories point to repo.anaconda.cloud rather than repo.anaconda.com
        4. If they do not, run conda token set $ANACONDA_TOKEN (replacing $ANACONDA_TOKEN with your actual token, or the environment variable name you defined earlier if applicable)
      review:
        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that your Anaconda package manager points to the right repositories
          Do the repositories in `conda info` point to repo.anaconda.cloud instead of repo.anaconda.com
        failedTaskHelp:
          This task isn’t verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully subscribed to Anaconda Commercial Edition
        failed: Try the steps again.
    - title: Install TensorFlow as an example of how to install Anaconda Commercial Edition packages
      description: |-
        ### To ensure you can install packages, install the Anaconda Commercial Edition TensorFlow package
        1. Open a notebook or terminal
        2. Run `conda install tensorflow` (notebooks will need to prefix this command with !, so `!conda install tensorflow`)
      review:
        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that you can import TensorFlow
          1. Inside a notebook, run: `import tensorflow as tf`
        failedTaskHelp:
          This task isn’t verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully installed and loaded the Anaconda Commercial Edition TensorFlow package
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to install Anaconda Commercial Edition packages, launch Jupyter notebooks, and write Python code.  If you want to learn how to deploy
    a model, take the next quick start.

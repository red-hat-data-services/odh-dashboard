    ### This quick start shows you how to run a JupyterHub Notebook that uses the available GPUs.
  tasks:
    - title: Import a JupyterHub Notebook into JupyterLab
      description: |-
        Prerequisite: User must know how to spawn a Notebook with at least 1 GPU attached. Complete the "Installing and verifying NVIDIA GPU add-on" if not completed already.

        1. In the top navigation panel click **Git**
        2. Click **Clone a repository**.
        3. Enter URL of the repository to be cloned : **https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/getting-started-with-gpus** and click **Clone**.

          #### To verify you have installed the GPU add-on:
          Can you see the "Getting started with GPUs" repository in the file navigation pane in JupyterHub?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully cloned the git repository and imported the notebook into JupyterHub.
        failed: Ensure you have met the prerequisites for the GPU add on and try the steps again.
    - title: Run the JupyterHub Notebook
      description: |-
        1. Double click the **torch-use-gpu.ipynb** file.
        2. Run the notebook. Each step within the notebook is explained within the notebook itself. The notebook has steps to verify existence of a GPU, as well as use the GPU for creating a model.

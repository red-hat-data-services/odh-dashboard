  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to launch a tensorflow image classifier model and detect when requests to the model are drifting.
    Seldon Deploy is a specialist set of tools designed to simplify and accelerate the process of deploying and managing your machine learning models.

    This quick start is a short version of https://deploy-master.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/drift/

        ### Deploy a pretrained image classifier model
        1. Open Seldon Console and click create. Deployment creation wizard appears.
        2. Choose type SeldonDeployment and protocol tensorflow and click next.
        3. Choose runtime tensorflow and enter the model url gs://seldon-models/tfserving/cifar10/resnet32
        4. Click through wizard to deploy the model
      summary:
        success: You have deployed a pretrained tensorflow image classifier
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy-master.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/drift/
    - title: Add a drift detector
      description: |-
        ### Deploy a drift detector for the image classifier
        1. From the image classifier model's page, go to the drift detector wizard
        2. Enter the model name cifar10 and url gs://seldon-models/alibi-detect/cd/ks/cifar10-0_4_3 for a drift detector.
        3. Set the batch size to 2, protocol to tensorflow and port to 8080
        3. Click through wizard to deploy the drift detector
      summary:
        success: The drift detector shows as loaded
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy-master.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/drift/
    - title: Make predictions
      description: |-
        ### Make predictions:
        1. Go to the make predictions screen
        2. Run a single prediction using the tensorflow payload format of an image truck - file is https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/cifar10_image.json
        3. Run a prediction payload format of an outlier/perturbed truck - file is https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/outlier_image.json
      summary:
        success: You see ok responses for each of the predictions.
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy-master.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/drift/
    - title: Monitor Drift
      description: |-
        ### Monitor Drift:
        1. Go to the monitor section of the deployment
        2. Under the ‘Monitor’ section of your deployment, you can see a timeline revealing drift of requests
      summary:
        success: You see graphs revealing drift of predictions.
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy-master.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/drift/
  conclusion: You are now able to identify drift in requests sent to the model.

  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to launch an income classifier model and see explanations.
    Seldon Deploy is a specialist set of tools designed to simplify and accelerate the process of deploying and managing your machine learning models.

    This quick start is a short version of https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/explainer-anchortabular/

        ### Deploy a pretrained income classifier model
        1. Open Seldon Console and click create. Deployment creation wizard appears.
        2. Choose type SeldonDeployment and click next.
        3. Choose runtime scikit-learn and enter the model url gs://seldon-models/sklearn/income/model-0.23.2
        4. Click through wizard to deploy the model
      summary:
        success: You have deployed a pretrained sklearn iris model
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/explainer-anchortabular/
    - title: Add an explainer

        ### Deploy a pretrained explainer model for the income classifier
        1. From the income classifier model's page, go to the alibi explainer wizard
        2. Enter the model url gs://seldon-models/sklearn/income/explainer-py36-0.5.2 for an Anchor Tabular explainer and use the defaults
        3. Click through wizard to deploy the explainer
      summary:
        success: The explainer shows as loaded
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/explainer-anchortabular/
    - title: Make a prediction and see explanations
      description: |-
        ### Make a prediction:
        1. Use this request payload to make a prediction {"data": {"names": ["Age","Workclass","Education","Marital Status","Occupation","Relationship","Race","Sex","Capital Gain","Capital Loss","Hours per week","Country"], "ndarray": [[53,4,0,2,8,4,2,0,0,0,60,9]]}}
        2. You should get a successful result back from the prediction.
        3. Click explain under the prediction to understand why this result was given by seeing anchors of most influential features
      summary:
        success: You see anchor-style explanations for income classifier model.
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/explainer-anchortabular/
  conclusion: You are now able to understand the predictions of the model.

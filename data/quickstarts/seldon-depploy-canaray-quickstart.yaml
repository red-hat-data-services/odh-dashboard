  prerequisites: [You completed the "Create a Jupyter notebook" quick start.]
  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to launch a SKLearn model and update model by canarying.
    Seldon Deploy is a specialist set of tools designed to simplify and accelerate the process of deploying and managing your machine learning models.

        ### Deploy a pretrained sklearn iris model
        1. Open Seldon Console and click create. Deployment creation wizard appears.
        2. Put the location of the model url. For example: gs://seldon-models/sklearn/iris 
      summary:
        success: You have deployed a pretrained sklearn iris model
        failed: Try the steps again.
    - title: Start Load Test
      description: |-
        ### Complete the load test wizard:
        1. Use the request.json file in this folder:
        2 {"data": {"names": ["Sepal length","Sepal width","Petal length", "Petal Width"], "ndarray": [[6.8,  2.8,  4.8,  1.4], [6.0,  3.4,  4.5,  1.6]]}}
        3. When running you should see metrics on dashboard. Enter the request logs screen to view request payloads.
      summary:
        success: You successfully performed a load test against the pre-trained iris model.
        failed: Try the steps again.
    - title: Create Canary
      description: |-
        ### Create and promote an XGBoost canary model
        1. Create an XGBoost canary model using the saved model at: gs://seldon-models/xgboost/iris
        2. Rerun the load test and you should see metrics for both default and canary models.
        3. Promote the XGBoost Canary to be the main model.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully promoted the XGBoost to be the canary model.
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to promote a model.

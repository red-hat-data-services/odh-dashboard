  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to launch a tensorflow image classifier model and detect requests which are outliers.
    Seldon Deploy is a specialist set of tools designed to simplify and accelerate the process of deploying and managing your machine learning models.

    This quick start is a short version of https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/

        ### Deploy a pretrained image classifier model
        1. Open Seldon Console and click create. Deployment creation wizard appears.
        2. Choose type SeldonDeployment and protocol tensorflow and click next.
        3. Choose runtime tensorflow and enter the model url gs://seldon-models/tfserving/cifar10/resnet32
        4. Click through wizard to deploy the model
      summary:
        success: You have deployed a pretrained tensorflow image classifier
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/
    - title: Add an outlier detector
      description: |-
        ### Deploy a pretrained outlier detector for the image classifier
        1. From the image classifier model's page, go to the outlier detector wizard
        2. Enter the model name cifar10 and url gs://seldon-models/alibi-detect/od/OutlierVAE/cifar10 for an outlier detector and use the defaults
        3. Click through wizard to deploy the outlier detector
      summary:
        success: The outlier detector shows as loaded
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/
    - title: Make predictions
      description: |-
        ### Make predictions:
        1. Go to the make predictions screen
        2. Run a single prediction using the tensorflow payload format of an image truck - file is https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/cifar10_image.json
        3. Run a prediction payload format of an outlier/perturbed truck - file is https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/outlier_image.json
      summary:
        success: You see ok responses for each of the predictions.
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/
    - title: Review Outliers
      description: |-
        ### Review Predictions/Outliers:
        1. Go to the requests screen (request log)
        2. Observe the outlier value on each instance.
        3. Optionally highlight outliers based on this score and also use the filter to see only the outliers as needed.
      summary:
        success: You see outlier scores for each of the predictions.
        failed: Try the steps again or see https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/outlier/
  conclusion: You are now able to identify outliers in requests sent to the model.

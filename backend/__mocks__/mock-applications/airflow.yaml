# Getting started

Visit the official Airflow website documentation (latest **stable** release) for help with [installing Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/installation.html), [getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/start.html), or walking through a more complete [tutorial](https://airflow.apache.org/tutorial.html).

> Note: If you're looking for documentation for master branch (latest development branch): you can find it on [s.apache.org/airflow-docs](https://s.apache.org/airflow-docs/).

For more information on Airflow's Roadmap or Airflow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), visit the [Airflow Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Home).

Official Docker (container) images for Apache Airflow are described in [IMAGES.rst](IMAGES.rst).

## Installing from PyPI

We publish Apache Airflow as `apache-airflow` package in PyPI. Installing it however might be sometimes tricky
because Airflow is a bit of both a library and application. Libraries usually keep their dependencies open and
applications usually pin them, but we should do neither and both at the same time. We decided to keep
our dependencies as open as possible (in `setup.py`) so users can install different versions of libraries
if needed. This means that from time to time plain `pip install apache-airflow` will not work or will
produce unusable Airflow installation.

In order to have repeatable installation, however, introduced in **Airflow 1.10.10** and updated in
**Airflow 1.10.12** we also keep a set of \"known-to-be-working\" constraint files in the
orphan `constraints-master`, `constraints-2-0` and `constraints-1-10` branches. We keep those \"known-to-be-working\"
constraints files separately per major/minor python version.
You can use them as constraint files when installing Airflow from PyPI. Note that you have to specify
correct Airflow tag/version/branch and python versions in the URL.


1. Installing just Airflow:

NOTE!!!

On November 2020, new version of PIP (20.3) has been released with a new, 2020 resolver. This resolver
might work with Apache Airflow as of 20.3.3, but it might lead to errors in installation. It might
depend on your choice of extras. In order to install Airflow reliably, you might need to either downgrade
pip to version 20.2.4 `pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4` or, in case you use Pip 20.3,
you might need to add option] `--use-deprecated legacy-resolver` to your pip install command.
While `pip 20.3.3` solved most of the `teething` problems of 20.3, this note will remain here until we
set `pip 20.3` as official version in our CI pipeline where we are testing the installation as well.
Due to those constraints, only `pip` installation is currently officially supported.

While they are some successes with using other tools like [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) or
[pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools), they do not share the same workflow as
`pip` - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management.
Installing via `Poetry` or `pip-tools` is not currently supported.

If you wish to install airflow using those tools you should use the constraint files and convert
them to appropriate format and workflow that your tool requires.


```bash
pip install apache-airflow==2.0.1 \
 --constraint \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.0.1/constraints-3.7.txt\"
```

2. Installing with extras (for example postgres,google)

```bash
pip install apache-airflow[postgres,google]==2.0.1 \
 --constraint \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.0.1/constraints-3.7.txt\"
```
